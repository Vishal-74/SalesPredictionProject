# Sales Prediction using Machine Learning

Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.

In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a Data Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machine learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.

## Getting Started

This project demonstrates how to perform sales prediction using simple linear regression in Python. We'll walk you through the process step by step.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for interactive exploration)
- Required Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn)

### Download the Dataset

To follow along with this project, download the sales prediction dataset from Kaggle using the following link:
